This plugin registers a new sidebar widget to be used on the ADMIN SIDE ONLY. When active it replaces the WP Welcome Panel Dashboard Widget. Inspired by and good for use with Dashboard Widget Sidebar, Dashboard Notes, Magic Widgets, and Enhanced Text Widget For completly "widgetizing" the wordpress admin. 

== Description ==

This plugin aims to merge development of frontend/backend wordpress themes and further the goal of really making wordpress a CMS and not just a blogging tool. Coming from Drupal, Wordpress is extremly frustrating when trying to build a back end theme. The wordpress backend needs to become more user friendly for theme developers who aren't coding experts. This small plugins goal is to contribute to that. When used with such plugins like Dashboard Widget Sidebar, Dashboard Notes, Magic Widgets, and Enhanced Text Widget admins are given complete control to build there admin interface in a very similar way that front end themes are build (BY USING WIDGETS). While there's really not that much too this plugin (as I'm not an expert coder myself), my hopes are that it will inspire better developers to take a more widget friendly approach to building admin interfaces. Building admin widgets gives us the opportunity to let designers take a stab at changing the administratoin interface. With such a large community the admin changes could have a lot more potential if we give designers and average users the ability to truely customize their entire site.
